# What is US-EA CENTRA?

US-EA CENTRA stands for US-East Asia Collaborations to Enable Transnational 
Cyberinfrastructure Applications and refers to a partnership and evolving 
framework for collaborations amongst research centers, institutes and 
laboratories in the USA and East-Asia countries.

# Mission

To be written.

# Objectives

CENTRA currently supports collaborative cyberinfrastructure research activities 
designed to educate a new generation of researchers who are technically and 
culturally competent to engage with international scientific networks. Two 
intertwined transformative global trends motivate the scope of technical 
research activities. One is the emergence of software-defined 
cyberinfrastructure, starting with networking components followed by compute and 
storage hardware and extending to middleware and application-software layers. 
The second trend is the emergence of data and software that can be used to help 
understand and solve problems of regional or global nature. These trends are 
intertwined because software-definition can enable heterogeneous transnational 
cyberinfrastructure and applications to interoperate and integrate and, 
conversely, the characteristics and requirements of transnational 
cyberinfrastructure and applications determine the kinds of software-definition 
that need to be implemented. The confluence of these two trends creates many 
novel research questions and disrupts many established IT solutions adopted for 
problems of local or national scope and homogeneous cyberinfrastructures whose 
IT stack components have a static nature with respect to their configuration and 
control. This projects pursues the rigorous understanding and solution of these 
scientific problems via international collaborations which bring out real-world 
contexts of transnational applications and create transnational 
cyberinfrastructure instances where researchers get practical insight.

# Collaborators

While administrated and operated from the University of Florida's
Advanced Computing and Informations Systems Laboratory, key institutional partners
in East Asia include the National Center for High-Performance Computing of the 
National Applied Research Laboratories of Taiwan and the National Institute of
Information and Communication Technologies of Japan. This project is to contribute
towards a framework to coordinate CI-based and CI-enabled research with East
Asian partners in order to achieve scientific progress and engage junior researchers
in international activities.

# Funding

CENTRA is funded in the USA by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). CENTRA 
partners include the Center of Excellence for Cyber-Enablement of Applications 
(CECEA) in Taiwan funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of 
Taiwan, and the ASEAN International Virtual Organization (IVO) funded by the 
National Institute of Information and Communications Technologies (NICT) of 
Japan.
