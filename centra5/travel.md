## Travel 

The State of Emergency has been declared in Portugal and brings into force a series of measures to curb down the spread of the virus (COVID-19).  

The pack of measures include significant restrictions on movement throughout the country, affecting public places and transport. They are in place since March 19, will be extended for another two weeks, and can be renewed. Public gatherings are prohibited, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies have been closed. People in the country have been instructed to remain at home.

Additionally, the EU has urged Member-States to introduce temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the Union.
