Porto was elected three times as the [Best European Destination](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/european-best-destinations-2017/), through the [European Best Destinations](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/) initiative (the last of which in 2017, after 2012 and 2014).

**How to get to the venue**

![inside_airport](../img/centra5/airport.png) ![map_airport](../img/centra5/airport_map.png)

**From Porto Airport:**

Porto’s Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, the second largest international airport in Portugal, was distinguished by Airports Council International as the best airport in Europe in 2018, in the category of 5 to 15 million passengers.  

Check [here](https://www.aeroportoporto.pt/en/opo/flights-destinations/airlines/airlines-and-destinations) what airlines offer flights from/to Porto.  

The airport is located approximately 7 miles / 11 kilometers away from the meeting venue and is served by several modes of public transportation.   

**Taxi and Uber: The easiest and fastest way to get to from the airport to the meeting venue and /or your hotel is by** [taxi](http://www.taxis-porto.pt/) or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/pt/en/). These are transport services that are permanently available to travelers at the airport arrivals entrance/exit. Both offer you the possibility to schedule the trip in advance or immediately after your plane lands.  
**Average fare (Taxi – one way): 25,00 €**  
**Average fare (Uber– one way): 12,00 €**  

**Metro:** Another possibility to consider, which is cheaper than the taxi (single ticket: 2,00 €), is the metro. The Airport is served by a single line (Line E - purple) that runs every 20 to 30 minutes and will take you to the historic city centre (end of line: Trindade station) in the same amount of time. If you wish to go directly to the meeting venue, you will have to get off a few stations before, i.e., at Francos, and then walk up to 15 minutes to reach the Crowne Plaza Hotel. See the [map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Francos,+Porto/Crowne+Plaza+Porto,+Avenida+da+Boavista,+Porto/@41.1630057,-8.6418303,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0xd2465a2edd50b5b:0x30215c822acb978c!2m2!1d-8.636347!2d41.165549!1m5!1m1!1s0xd24659efd4e5e9b:0xc695ad1f002380ec!2m2!1d-8.6406733!2d41.1601724!3e2).

**From Campanhã Train Station (for international visitors flying to Lisbon)**

Porto is approximately 300 kms /205 miles away from Lisbon. If you are flying to Lisbon International Airport (Humberto Delgado airport) and planning to get to Porto by train (Alfa Pendular or Intercidades) you should buy a ticket at Lisbon’s Gare do Oriente Station to Vila Nova de Gaia-Devesas Station, where you’ll need to get off. Once more, the taxi or Uber is rather convenient, since the conference venue is only 12 kms or 7,5 miles away from Vila Nova de Gaia-Devesas Station and the price is likely to be around 25/31,20 €.  

Detailed information about trains, timetables, journey times and ticket fares may be found [here](https://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en).
