The Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) was created in 1926. Still, its history began a century before within the Polytechnic Academy of Porto to "plant industry science in the country".   

The Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto undertakes education, research, and innovation activities at the international level. The results of these activities lead to the creation and transfer of knowledge, training of competent and ethical professionals, future leaders in engineering and similar areas, and the promotion of our global society’s well-being.  

With a workforce of over 1.000 collaborators, including more than 600 teachers, FEUP offers over 90 degree and non-degree courses, which enrolled around 9.000 students in the last academic year.
