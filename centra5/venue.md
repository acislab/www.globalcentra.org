The hotel is located right in the heart of one of the city’s main business and shopping districts (*Avenida da Boavista*), served by several bus lines and within 15-minute walking-distance from Casa da Música Metro Station.

The hotel is on the route of one of the hop-on hop-off buses that will take you in a memorable journey to some of the many must-see attractions the city has to offer travelers: the historic center of Porto, the Clérigos Bell Tower, the Serralves Foundation and Casa da Música, two icons of the city’s contemporary architecture, or even the Porto Cruise terminal.

By taxi or Uber, you can easily and conveniently reach **Porto’s historic downtown** or **Porto Airport** in just under 20 minutes.


### Suggested hotels:

We have selected a number of hotels located either in the vicinity of the meeting venue or closer to Porto’s major tourist attractions if you wish to experience a more immersive stay in the city. The list includes a range of prices and star-ratings in order to cater for all tastes and wallets.

INESC TEC has negotiated special rates with these hotels. To benefit from such rates, **you will need to first register for the meeting**. At the time of registration confirmation, you will be given a promo code or a reservation link that you can use at any of the hotels in the list.

Please, note that, in May, Porto is a stage for a vast array of events and attracts many tourist and business travelers. We strongly suggest that you book early your accommodation to avoid disappointment.

The Organization Team of the CENTRA 5 Meeting will be accountable neither for reservations/ confirmations nor cancellations.
