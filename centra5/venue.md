**Accommodation \| List of suggested hotels:** 

The list of suggested hotels for 2021 will be updated in the coming months. 
If you have reserved a room at a hotel in Porto to attend the 2020 CENTRA 5 Meeting, do not forget to contact your hotel for assistance / cancellation.  

<!--

We have selected a number of hotel units located either in the vicinity of the meeting venue or closer to Porto’s major tourist attractions if you wish to experience a more immersive stay in the city. The list includes a range of prices and star-ratings in order to cater for all tastes and wallets.  

IINESC TEC has negotiated with these hotels special conditions (such as special rates or room block) for CENTRA 5 Meeting’s delegates (e.). 

- In order to benefit from such conditions, you will need to first register for the meeting. At the time of registration confirmation, depending on the hotel you would like to stay at, you will be given either a promo code or a reservation link that you can use to book directly with the hotel.
- Please, note that, in May, Porto is a stage for a vast array of events and attracts many tourist and business travelers. We strongly suggest that you book early your accommodation to avoid disappointment.

The Organization Team of the CENTRA 5 Meeting will be accountable neither for reservations/ confirmations nor cancellations.

**Crowne Plaza Porto**, at this point in time, is already fully booked for the 13th of May 2020. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

The situation is, however, likely to change as some group/individual reservations may be cancelled. Therefore, you can always check with the hotel whether any booked room has been released in the meantime. Also, the Local Organizing Team will go on updating this section with information about room availability at Crowne Plaza Porto.
