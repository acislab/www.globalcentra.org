**Accommodation \| List of suggested hotels:** 

We have selected a number of hotel units located either in the vicinity of the meeting venue or closer to Porto’s major tourist attractions if you wish to experience a more immersive stay in the city. The list includes a range of prices and star-ratings in order to cater for all tastes and wallets.
  
INESC TEC has negotiated special rates with these hotels. To benefit from such rates, **you will need to first register for the meeting. At the time of registration confirmation, you will be given a promo code or a reservation link that you can use at any of the hotels on the list**.  

The Organizing Team of the CENTRA 5 Meeting will be accountable neither for reservations/ confirmations nor cancellations.

- **For the criterion *convenience*, Crowne Plaza Porto**ranks first on our list of suggested hotels.  The Organizing Team will go on updating this section with information about room availability at these hotels.

The situation is, however, likely to change as some group/individual reservations may be cancelled. Therefore, you can always check with the hotel whether any booked room has been released in the meantime. Also, the Local Organizing Team will go on updating this section with information about room availability at Crowne Plaza Porto.
