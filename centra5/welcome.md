Dear all,

We could not be more excited to welcome you in May 2020 at the UNESCO’s World Heritage City of Porto for the first CENTRA Meeting ever held in Europe. This is a true sign that the collaborative and partnering framework CENTRA stands for is expanding beyond its original borders and strengthening the foundations for a truly global and impactful cyberinfrastructure research and innovation community.

2020 is a year of celebration for INESC TEC. We will be commemorating 35 years of commitment to scientific knowledge advancement and technology transfer in leading application domains and to forging long-lasting partnerships, first in Portugal, and over the years, across several regions of the globe. As an interface organization that has been successfully bridging academia with industries and application markets and is more than ever engaged in internationalization activities, being part of CENTRA’s community is a great honor and stimulus to INESC TEC’s role as a connecting transnational S&T partner.

Therefore, once again, we really look forward to meeting you all in Porto, a city with a character of its own that has been a gateway for a new and more connected world for centuries. What a perfect stage to host the 5th edition of our CENTRA meeting!

CENTRA activities are funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF ACI Award 1550126) of the USA, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan, the National Institute of Information and Communications Technologies (NICT) of Japan, and the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC) of Portugal. We are very thankful for the support of all these sponsors.

President of INESC TEC, José Manuel Mendonça
