<!--Dear all,

We could not be more excited to welcome you in May 2020 at the UNESCO’s World Heritage City of Porto for the first CENTRA Meeting ever held in Europe. This is a true sign that the collaborative and partnering framework CENTRA stands for is expanding beyond its original borders and strengthening the foundations for a truly global and impactful cyberinfrastructure research and innovation community.

2020 is a year of celebration for INESC TEC. We will be commemorating 35 years of commitment to scientific knowledge advancement and technology transfer in leading application domains and to forging long-lasting partnerships, first in Portugal, and over the years, across several regions of the globe. As an organization that has been successfully bridging academia with industries and application markets and is more than ever engaged in internationalization activities, being part of CENTRA’s community is a great honor and stimulus to INESC TEC’s role as a connecting transnational S&T partner.

Therefore, once again, we really look forward to meeting you all in Porto, a city with a character of its own that has been a gateway for a new and more connected world for centuries. What a perfect stage to host the 5th edition of our CENTRA meeting!

CENTRA's activities are funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF ACI Award 1550126) of the USA, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan, the National Institute of Information and Communications Technologies (NICT) of Japan, and the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC) of Portugal. We are very thankful for the support of all these sponsors.

José Manuel Mendonça<br>
President of INESC TEC-->

After thoughtful deliberations, and because our members’ health and safety come first, CENTRA’s Steering Committee (SC) has decided to postpone CENTRA 5 Meeting to May 2021 due to the COVID-19.  

We hope you understand our decision, which was not made lightly. At the same time, we want to assure you that we are committed to go the extra mile with the 2021 event. Porto and INESC TEC will remain the host city and the local organizer respectively.  

In the meantime, we will be updating CENTRA 5 Meeting website with information referring to next year’s annual event (including logistic details) and CENTRA’s SC has just started working on online activities / events for CENTRA’s community to keep as engaged and active as ever until we are all able to meet face-to-face.   

The first event in the pipeline, to happen in July 2020 in a fully digital format, will provide CENTRA’s members with a unique opportunity to get together to report on progress of existing projects, discuss ideas for new ones and get feedback from peers. This virtual mini-meeting, coordinated by INESC TEC, is particularly important for those of you who had been submitting proposals for the 2020 CENTRA 5 Meeting and were expecting to present their research work this year in Porto.  

So, we invite you all to stay tuned over the next months and wish you health and peace of mind as we make together our way through these exceptionally challenging times!  
  
José Manuel Mendonça  
President of INESC TEC
