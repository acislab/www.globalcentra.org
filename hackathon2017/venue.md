# Student Hackathon Venue

The Advanced Computing and Information Systems lab (ACIS) in UF's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
is providing its modern re-configurable CENTRA office suite to host this hackathon. Located on the top floor of Benton Hall,
this space normally houses graduate student work spaces but the movable glass walls will be opened up to provide a collaborative workspace with movable tables, networking, projectors, whiteboards, multi-monitor visualization wall, video conferencing, and cappuccino machine. A more private back office and conference room will be available for those who want quiet space. More traditional private office space can be made available for napping.


## Lodging

For our international participants, please see the [lodging information](http://www.globalcentra.org/centra2/venue.html) for the main CENTRA meeting being
held on April 10th. If you are remaining in Gainesville between the hackathon and the CENTRA, SUNTOWNS, or PRAGMA meetings, we would be happy to arrange working spaces, campus tours, and other activities in the area. Please contact Grace Hong at [gshong@acis.ufl.edu](mailto://gshong@acis.ufl.edu) .
