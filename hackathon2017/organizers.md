# Student Hackathon Team

Throughout the Hackathon, the organizing team will be available to help with
logistics, UF campus information, and technical issues. Our mentor team will be
available to help with using technology like Spark or GitHub as well as to make
suggestions about how to approach problems related to your hack. (Information
and suggestions provided by mentors will be available to all teams for
fairness.)
