The CENTRA international collaboration project is excited to announce its first

Saturday, April 1<sup>st</sup> and Sunday, April 2<sup>nd</sup> to build
applications, data visualizations, analyses, or anything you can think of around
[Smart Cities](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2986403/internet-of-
things/just- what-is-a-smart-city.html) - using open data and the Internet of
Things to improve residents' life.

Come join us to **learn** about Smart Cities, open-access data sets,
colalborative software development, and **meet great people** and **win a paid
trip to present in Japan**!

## Topics

The CENTRA Hackathon will focus on analizing data from three existing Smart
Cities: [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/),
[Gainesville](https://data.cityofgainesville.org/), and
[Taipai](http://data.taipei/), Taiwan. Each city has a public data portal that
can enable inovative software applications, visualizations, or analyses that can
improve the life of city residents. Some of this data is collected by
[IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) sensors which


Some examples of the types of data availible:

* `A web portal to someone's data`
* [Map](https://airbox.edimaxcloud.com/) of [AirBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-J430gWrk) air quality data
