# Smart Cities Student Hackathon

**Saturday April 1 - Sunday April 2**

The CENTRA international collaboration project is excited to announce its first
hackathon! We welcome any enrolled student from the US or abroad to join us on
Saturday, April 1<sup>st</sup> and Sunday, April 2<sup>nd</sup> to build
applications, data visualizations, analyses, or anything you can think of around
[Smart Cities](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2986403/internet-of-
things/just- what-is-a-smart-city.html) - using open data and the Internet of
Things to improve residents' life.

Come join us to **learn** about Smart Cities, open-access data sets,
collaborative software development, and **meet great people** and **win a paid
trip to present in Japan**!

## Topics

We will welcome any hack focused on collecting or analyzing data from three
existing Smart Cities: [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/),
[Gainesville](https://data.cityofgainesville.org/), and
[Taipei](http://data.taipei/), Taiwan. Each city has a public data portal that
can enable innovative software applications, visualizations, or analyses that can
improve the life of city residents. Some of this data is collected by
[IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) sensors. Any other open
data source can be used as well for information such as weather, economic,
geographic, etc.

Some examples of Smart Cities:

* [Analyzing Chicago taxi rides](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/chicago-taxi-data/)
* [Map](https://airbox.edimaxcloud.com/) of [AirBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-J430gWrk) air quality data
* [Graphing electricity usage in Gainesville](https://github.com/mjcollin/gnv_data/blob/master/gru_graph.ipynb)

## Prizes

* **First Prize** - Paid travel & lodging for up to two members of the winning team to 
present their work at the next [CENTRA](http://www.globalcentra.org) / [PRAGMA](http://www.pragma-grid.net)
meeting, tentatively planned to take place in Japan, 2018.
* **Second Prize** - Something cool!
* **All participants** - Certificate and conference swag!

Judging criteria will be available at the hackathon but will include *wowness*,
*uniqueness*, and *technical skill*.

## Teams

Participants are encouraged to work in teams of up to 4 students. Don't have a
team in mind already? The first hour will be focused on introductions and
forming ideas. This is your opportunity to find others interested in the smart
hacks as you.
