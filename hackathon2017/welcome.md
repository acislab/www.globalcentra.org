# Smart Cities Student Hackathon

**Saturday April 1 - Sunday April 2**

The CENTRA international collaboration project is excited to announce its first
hackathon! We welcome any enrolled student from the US or abroad to join us on
Saturday, April 1<sup>st</sup> and Sunday, April 2<sup>nd</sup> to build
applications, data visualizations, analyses, or anything you can think of around
[Smart Cities](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2986403/internet-of-
things/just- what-is-a-smart-city.html). Come use open data and the Internet of
Things to improve residents' lives.

This research-oriented hackathon will be the kick-off event for the following week's (April 10 - 14) 
international conferences centered around Smart and Connected Communities. All hackathon participants are invited to these conferences to 
meet researchers and students from Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, San Diego, UF, and other institutions to discuss
their hacks, research, and other interests.

**Participation gets you**

* 23 hours of **hands-on hacking** with Smart Cities data
* Hack with students from **three countries**
* Meet **developers** and **graduate students** experienced in big data technologies
* **Workshops** on data APIs, collaborative software development, and big data analysis
* **Invitations** to the [CENTRA 2 meeting](/centra2/), [SUNTOWNS workshop](suntowns2017/), and [PRAGMA 32 meeting](http://pragma32.pragma-grid.net/) during the week of April 10 - 14
* Paid opportunity to present your work **in Japan**


## The Hackathon Focus

We will welcome any hack focused on collecting or analysing data from Smart Cities.
Below are some examples from three cities: [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/),
[Gainesville](https://data.cityofgainesville.org/), and
[Taipei](http://data.taipei/), Taiwan. Each city has a public data portal that
can enable software applications, visualizations, or analyses that can
improve the life of city residents. Any other open
data source can be used for information such as weather, economic,
geographic, etc.

Some examples of Smart Cities:

* [Analyzing Chicago taxi rides](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/chicago-taxi-data/)
* [Map](https://airbox.edimaxcloud.com/) of [AirBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-J430gWrk) air quality data
* [Graphing electricity usage in Gainesville](https://github.com/mjcollin/gnv_data/blob/master/gru_graph.ipynb)

## Participants

We are inviting students from our [CENTRA](http://www.globalcentra.org) and [PRAGMA](http://www.pragma-grid.net) partner countries including Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand as well as the University of Florida community.

## Prizes

* **First Prize** - Paid travel & lodging for up to two members of the winning team to 
present their research at the next [CENTRA](http://www.globalcentra.org) / [PRAGMA](http://www.pragma-grid.net)
meeting, currently planned to take place in Japan, 2018
* **Best Two Hacks** - Present your hack during the [SUNTOWNS workshop](suntowns2017/) on April 12th (special opening speaker [Kent Fuchs](http://president.ufl.edu/about/fuchs/))
* **All participants** - Certificate and conference swag!

Judging criteria will be available at the hackathon but will include *wowness*,
*uniqueness*, and *technical skill*.

## Teams

Participants are encouraged to work in teams of up to 4 students. Don't have a
team in mind already? The first hour will be focused on introductions and
forming ideas. This is your opportunity to find others interested in the same smart
hacks as you.
