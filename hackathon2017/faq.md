# Student Hackathon Frequently Asked Questions

* How do I register?

* Can I sign up if I'm not on a team?

* What will be provided?

We will provide hackathon basics such as food, wireless internet, quite workspaces, whiteboards, etc.
We will also provide datasets from our example smart cities in a GitHub repository that will be 
available the Wednesday before the hackathon starts. You can review the datasets ahead of time to
get ideas and we will have a presentation on how to access them and what they contain at the 
beginning of the hackathon.

* What should I bring?

* Will there be food?

Yes! All meals, drinks, and snacks will be provided from the starting breakfast to the ending lunch.

* What is this GitHub thing?

GitHub is a web site for writing software and working collaboratively with others. We will use it during
the hackathon as a place for everyone to put their code and presentations. A workshop on using GitHub will
be held during the hackathon.

* Where can I sleep?

The CENTRA suite will remain open all night however you are welcome to return to your home or hotel
to continue working.
