# Student Hackathon Frequently Asked Questions

* **How can I communicate with everyone?**

There is a GitHub organization:

[https://github.com/centrahackathon2017](https://github.com/centrahackathon2017)

And a Slack team:

[https://centrahackathon2017.slack.com/](https://centrahackathon2017.slack.com/)

* **What will be provided?**

We will provide hackathon basics such as food, wireless internet, quite
workspaces, whiteboards, etc. We will also provide datasets from our example
smart cities in a GitHub repository that will be  available the Wednesday before
the hackathon starts. You can review sample datasets ahead of time to get ideas
and we will have a presentation on how to access them and what they contain at
the beginning of the hackathon. You can also bring your own data or use data
from any other open source.

We will also provide access to computational resources including:

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> cluster with <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> interface</li>
    <li>Virtual machines for computation and services with public IPs</li>
    <li>A few large (256 GB RAM, 64 core) servers</li>
    <li>Storage space (10 TB)</li>
</ul>
</div>

* **What should I bring?**

Your computer, chargers, headphones, whatever you need to be creative (pens,
graph paper, post-its, butterfly stickers, etc.) as well as a few toiletries.
Remember, we'll all be together in one space for 26 hours.

* **Will there be food?**

Of course! Meals, beverages and snacks will be provided :-)

* **What is GitHub?**

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web site for writing software and working
collaboratively with others. We will use it during the hackathon as a place for
everyone to put their code and presentations. A workshop on using GitHub will be
held during the hackathon. You can also [read their
tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

* **Where can I sleep?**

The CENTRA suite will remain open all night however you are welcome to return to
your home or hotel to continue working. We will have some bean bags and chairs availible if you want something more comfortable than an office chair to rest in. Your entire team must present your work on Sunday so be sure to come back.

* **What presentation do I need to make?**

When the hackathon ends at 11:00 am Sunday, each team will have 3 minutes to present their hack to the entire group and the judges. There will be an opportunity for the judges to ask up to two questions. We encourage you to not use slides for your presentaion. Please show your code running or your application in use. If you chose to do a data analysis, then slides may be appropriate for showing graphs and results. **All team members must be present at the presentation to be eligible to win**

* **What are the judging expectations?**

Our judging panel will review your presentation and hack based on:

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">
<ol>
    <li>Wowness and creativity of the hack</li>
    <li>Consideration paid to improving communities</li>
    <li>Ability for the hack to become a research project</li>
    <li>Technical, artistic, organizational, etc skills requried to do the hack</li>
    <li>How well the presentation conveys the work you did</li>
</ol>
</div>

We will **not** be using any of these criteria for judging:

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">
<ul>
    <li>Public speaking skills</li>
    <li>Immediate applicability of the hack</li>
    <li>Ability for the hack to become a research project</li>
    <li>Marketability or comercial value of the hack</li>
    <li>Previous work done on the hack outside the hackathon</li>
</ul>
</div>

Basically, you'll be judged on the creativity and quality of the work you did this weekend.

* **If I win, where do I get to go?**

The best two hacks will be able to do their hack presentation again at closing session of the SUNTOWNS (Smart University Towns) workshop on Wednesday April 12 at the Hilton University conference center. This workshop will feature talks and panels by community members and international researchers in the Smart Cities domain including Dr. Kent Fuch, persident of UF; Anthony Lyons, Gainesville city manager; and Glenn Ricart, Founder and CTO of US Ignite. The full program is below. Note that the group photo is at 8:40 am so if you want your picture taken with everyone, please come for the whole day!

* **Even if I don't win, what events can I attend the week of April 10 - 14?**



The [SUNTOWNS (Smart University Towns) workshop](http://www.globalcentra.org/suntowns2017/) on Wednesday April 12 at the Hilton University conference center is open to everyone who attends the hackathon and will feature talks and panels by community members and international researchers in the Smart Cities domain.

* **How do I register?**

<!--

Registration has ended.

* **Can I sign up if I'm not on a team?**

Absolutely. Before hacking starts we will have time for everyone to discuss
their ideas and have opportunities for participants to work with people
interested in the same hacks. Or on their own hacks, it's up to you.
