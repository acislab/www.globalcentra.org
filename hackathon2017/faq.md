# Student Hackathon Frequently Asked Questions

* **How can I communicate with everyone?**

There is a GitHub organization:

[https://github.com/centrahackathon2017](https://github.com/centrahackathon2017)

And a Slack team:

[https://centrahackathon2017.slack.com/](https://centrahackathon2017.slack.com/)

* **What will be provided?**

We will provide hackathon basics such as food, wireless internet, quite
workspaces, whiteboards, etc. We will also provide datasets from our example
smart cities in a GitHub repository that will be  available the Wednesday before
the hackathon starts. You can review sample datasets ahead of time to get ideas
and we will have a presentation on how to access them and what they contain at
the beginning of the hackathon. You can also bring your own data or use data
from any other open source.

We will also provide access to computational resources including:

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> cluster with <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> interface</li>
    <li>Virtual machines for computation and services with public IPs</li>
    <li>A few large (256 GB RAM, 64 core) servers</li>
    <li>Storage space (10 TB)</li>
</ul>
</div>

* **What should I bring?**

Your computer, chargers, headphones, whatever you need to be creative (pens,
graph paper, post-its, butterfly stickers, etc.) as well as a few toiletries.
Remember, we'll all be together in one space for 26 hours.

* **Will there be food?**

Of course! Meals, beverages and snacks will be provided :-)

* **What is GitHub?**

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web site for writing software and working
collaboratively with others. We will use it during the hackathon as a place for
everyone to put their code and presentations. A workshop on using GitHub will be
held during the hackathon. You can also [read their
tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

* **Where can I sleep?**

The CENTRA suite will remain open all night however you are welcome to return to
your home or hotel to continue working. We will have some bean bags and chairs availible if you want something more comfortable than an office chair to rest in. Your entire team must present your work on Sunday so be sure to come back.

* **What presentation do I need to make?**

* **What are the judging expectations?**

* **If I win, where do I get to go?**

* **Even if I don't win, what events can I attend the week of April 10 - 14?**

* **How do I register?**

<!--
<a href="https://acislab.wufoo.com/forms/rkg5ct30h8e452/" alt="registration">Registration is now open!</a>
-->
Registration has ended.

* **Can I sign up if I'm not on a team?**

Absolutely. Before hacking starts we will have time for everyone to discuss
their ideas and have opportunities for participants to work with people
interested in the same hacks. Or on their own hacks, it's up to you.
