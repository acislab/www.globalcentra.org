# Student Hackathon Frequently Asked Questions

* **How do I register?**

Registration will be open February 8th.

* **Can I sign up if I'm not on a team?**

Absolutely. Before hacking starts we will have time for everyone to discuss
their ideas and have opportunities for participants to work with people
interested in the same hacks. Or on their own hacks, it's up to you.

* **What will be provided?**

We will provide hackathon basics such as food, wireless internet, quite
workspaces, whiteboards, etc. We will also provide datasets from our example
smart cities in a GitHub repository that will be  available the Wednesday before
the hackathon starts. You can review sample datasets ahead of time to get ideas
and we will have a presentation on how to access them and what they contain at
the beginning of the hackathon. You can also bring your own data or use data
from any other open source.

We will also provide access to computational resources including large servers
and virtual machines.

* **What should I bring?**

Your computer, chargers, headphones, whatever you need to be creative (pens,
graph paper, post-its, butterfly stickers, etc.) as well as a few toiletries.
Remember, we'll all be together in one space for 26 hours.

* **Will there be food?**

Of course! All meals, drinks, coffee, tea, and snacks will be provided from the
starting breakfast to the ending lunch.

* **What is this GitHub thing?**

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web site for writing software and working
collaboratively with others. We will use it during the hackathon as a place for
everyone to put their code and presentations. A workshop on using GitHub will be
held during the hackathon. You can also [read their
tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

* **Where can I sleep?**

The CENTRA suite will remain open all night however you are welcome to return to
your home or hotel to continue working.
