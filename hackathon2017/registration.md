# Student Hackathon Registration

Space in this hackathon limited to 24 people. If we have more applicants, we
will select those who register who we think are best prepared to succeed. Please
complete the questions on the registration form and include either your resume
and/or a link to a site like LinkedIn or your personal web site so we have
enough information to select excellent students. When evaluating registrations
we will also try to have participation from as many institutions as possible.

In doubt? Register!


**Registration is not yet open for this event**

Please check back on February 6th.
