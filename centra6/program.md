## CENTRA 6 Meeting Program


A draft and general outline of the agenda and CENTRA 6 program is availble on the SCHED platform [here](https://centra6.sched.com/). 

The SCHED platform allows attendees to create a profile (or us a SCHED profile from another event) to connect and network with other folks attending CENTRA 6.

Pro-tips! In SCHED, click on SCHEDULE (next to SPEAKERS, AUTHORS, etc) and then choose EXPANDED view to see the abstracts of each talk and the speakers name.

If you think other folks are able to see your profile but you see an image on your own profile that says YOUR PROFILE & SCHEDULE ARE HIDDEN FROM ATTENDEES when you click on your own profile or click on your profile image, then you need to go to settings and change your settings to be public so everyone attending can see you.

We strongly encourage everyone to create a SCHED profile and upload your photo and biographical information. Creating your profile on SCHED and encouraging others to do the same is your best bet for learning about all the attendees and networking with others who attend CENTRA 6.

To make your SCHED profile public:
- Go [here](https://centra6.sched.com/)
- Login to SCHED.
- Click on your image or initials in upper right corner
- Choose SETTINGS
- Under Privacy & Email, turn the switch for MAKE MY PROFILE & SCHEDULE PUBLIC to green.
- You can update other information in your schedule (like a photo and institutional affiliation)
- IMPORTANT: Scroll all the way to bottom and choose SAVE SETTINGS

All hours according to the current local time in Indiana/New York. For time zone conversions, check out this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html)
