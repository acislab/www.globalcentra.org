## Workshop on Globally Situated Perspectives on AI in the Edge-Cloud Continuum
A precursor workshop to the CENTRA 6 Meeting

While the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is practically unlimited, its ramifications are often contextual based on localized (country) situations. We invite CENTRA researchers, practitioners, and professionals to submit short abstracts to the 1-day Workshop on Globally Situated Perspectives on AI in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. The workshop aims for a series of short papers that explore artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing, specifically focusing on:
- Regional or global issues in the continuum from edge devices to cloud infrastructure for AI
- Global research partnerships for rapid responses to global issues
- Edge computing architectures and post 5G implications for AI applications
- Lightweight and efficient AI models for edge devices, Edge-based AI inference optimization techniques
- Resource management, workload allocation, data sharing in edge-cloud systems, Hybrid edge-cloud architectures for AI applications
- AI ethics and trustworthiness

[A draft schedule for the workshop is available via SCHED](https://centra6.sched.com/)

## Submission Guidelines:

- We welcome 1-2 page abstracts (U.S. letter – 8.5″x11″), using the [IEEE proceedings template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Abstracts must be submitted as a PDF file.
- Submissions must be original and should present novel research contributions or innovative practical applications related to the workshop topics. 
- Authors may submit their contributions to [PTI@IU](mailto:pti@iu.edu).
- Abstracts will be published as a collection to [IUScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/).
- Optional: In lieu of an abstract, authors may submit a five-page paper as the final deliverable.
