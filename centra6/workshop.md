## Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum

While the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is practically unlimited, its ramifications are often contextual and based on localized (country) situations.   We invite CENTRA researchers, practitioners, and professionals to submit short abstracts to the 1-day pre-CENTRA 6 workshop.  The workshop aims for a series of short papers that explore artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing, with specific interest in:
-Globally situated perspectives in AI Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum Edge computing architectures for AI applications
-Distributed machine learning on edge-cloud environments
-Lightweight and efficient AI models for edge devices; networking for Edge-based AI 
-Resource management and workload allocation in edge-cloud systems; Hybrid edge-cloud architectures for AI applications
-Data sharing in edge-cloud environments; Ethical considerations in AI deployments at the edge
-Global research partnerships for rapid responses to global issues

## Submission Guidelines:

-We welcome 1-2 page abstracts (U.S. letter – 8.5″x11″), using the IEEE proceedings template. Abstracts must be submitted as a PDF file.
-Submissions must be original and should present novel research contributions or innovative practical applications related to the workshop topics. 
-Authors may submit their contributions to pti@iu.edu .
-Abstracts will be published as a collection to IUScholarWorks.
-Optional: In lieu of an abstract, authors may submit a five-page paper as the final deliverable.

## Important Dates:

-Submissions must be received by August 25, 2023 to be considered.
