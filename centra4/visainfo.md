## CENTRA 2018 Visa Information
  
***CENTRA 3 Meeting has concluded. All contact and external links information have expired or been removed. Content on this page is for archival purpose only.***

If you need to obtain a Japanese visa, please contact CENTRA 3 secretariat as soon as possible, no later than April 1st. The secretariat will provide the necessary documents for your visa application.  

If you are not sure, please check the latest Exemption of Visa information on Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan official web site, whether nationals of your country are required to obtain a visa to enter Japan. Nationals and citizens of those countries and regions shown in the list are not required to obtain visas to enter Japan when their periods of stay are short-term and visits are for tourism, commerce, conferences, visiting relatives/ acquaintances, etc.  

Please note that it may take more than a month for visa issuance. The time required between visa application and issuance varies by country. We therefore suggest that you contact the Consular Section of the Embassy or Consulate General of Japan nearest to you for more information and advice, and apply for visa well in advance.  

Please be aware that providing necessary documents for your visa application do not imply any financial support. Travel expenses incurred to your participation in the PRAGMA / CENTRA Japan Meeting 2018 are the responsibility of the participant himself/herself. Please work with your funding source for financial support documentation should it be required for your Japanese visa application.
