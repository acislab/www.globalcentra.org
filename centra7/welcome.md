Dear Colleagues,<br /><br />

On behalf of the CENTRA 7 Organizing Committee, the Digital Architecture Research Center (DigiARC) at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) is pleased to invite our colleagues from around the globe to the 7th CENTRA meeting on February 6-9, 2024 in Tokyo, Japan. CENTRA 7 will include two symposiums, presentations, and breakout sessions for continuing collaboration with our international partners.<br /><br />

We see the meeting as a great opportunity to continue the momentum from the previous CENTRA meeting and for global exchange of ideas on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Edge-Cloud Continuum related topics. In keeping with the spirit of all globalCENTRA meetings, we are prioritizing the creation of a venue where global collaboration can thrive. We are continuing the arrangement of time and spaces to allow for fruitful presentations and discussions, as well as collaborative interaction in non-meeting room environments. We also will introduce new topics such as quantum computing to inspire new areas of global collaboration.<br /><br />

Tokyo is perhaps a city that needs no introduction. With a population of almost 14 million, it is an exciting metropolis with a tremendous selection of food, shopping, and cultural locations. The meeting venue will take place at the AIST Waterfront campus for the first day and at the Miraikan Museum on the remaining days, both located next to each other in the Odaiba area of Tokyo.<br /><br />

The Digital Architecture Research Center was established to develop and implement technologies that promote the digital revolution as a contribution to solving social issues and fostering innovation. Our aim is to realize an advanced society that provides new services and value for all individuals and organizations by highly integrating cyberspace and physical space while utilizing AI technology through the coordination of research units to advance the data-driven digital society. The fusion of edge and cloud through a continuum and the integration of new technologies such as quantum-AI hybrid resources are central ideas that drive the architectural design, necessary technology development, standardization, software implementation and dissemination activities of our center.<br /><br />

I am very honored to be able to host the 7th global CENTRA meeting and look forward to seeing you in Tokyo!<br /><br />

Dr. Hiro Kishimoto<br />
Center Director<br />

Dear Colleagues,  <br /><br />

On behalf of the CENTRA 6 Organizing Committee, welcome to CENTRA 6: AI in the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum! <br /><br />
 
The Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI) at Indiana University (IU) is delighted to invite you, our colleagues from around the globe, to the 6th CENTRA meeting, to be held September 12-15, 2023, at the Indiana University Indianapolis campus (IUPUI). CENTRA 6 will include a 1-day workshop, <a href="https://www.globalcentra.org/centra6/workshop.html">Globally Situated Perspectives on AI in the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum</a>, for talks on early research. <br /><br />

We see the meeting as a timely opportunity for global exchange of ideas on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum. As with all globalCENTRA meetings, creating a venue where global collaboration can thrive is a priority. We are thus arranging the time and spaces to allow for fruitful presentations and discussions, as well as collaborative interaction in non-meeting room settings. As AI isn’t just a technical problem, we will foster discussions that cross the social-technical threshold as well. <br /><br />

Indiana is affectionately known as the Hoosier State, those of us who have resided in the state long enough know well enough to identify ourselves as “hoosiers” (origination unknown). Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana, and the IU Indianapolis campus, where we’ll be meeting, sits on the winding White River. With its path system, the White River is an attraction for morning walks. The meeting venue on campus is a close walk to two showcase museums, The Eiteljorg Museum and the Indiana State Museum. <br /><br />

Indiana University has substantial research and innovation in international and national networking, informatics and computing, and big data. It is home to one of the fastest university-owned supercomputers in the world, a world class global network operations center (GNOC), the Jetstream2 community cloud for science research, and a new Luddy Artificial Intelligence Institute. <br /><br />

I am genuinely ecstatic to be able to host the 6th global CENTRA meeting, and the first fully in-person meeting since pre-COVID. We look forward to seeing you at CENTRA 6! <br /><br />

Executive Director, Pervasive Technology Institute<br />
Michael A and Laurie Burns McRobbie Bicentennial Professor of Computer Engineering, Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering<br />
