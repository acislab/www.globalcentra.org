Dear Colleagues,  <br /><br />

On behalf of the CENTRA 6 Organizing Committee, welcome to CENTRA 6: AI in the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum! <br /><br />
 
The Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI) at Indiana University (IU) is delighted to invite you, our colleagues from around the globe, to the 6th CENTRA meeting, to be held September 12-15, 2023, at the Indiana University Indianapolis campus (IUPUI). CENTRA 6 will include a 1-day workshop, <a href="https://www.globalcentra.org/centra6/workshop.html">Globally Situated Perspectives on AI in the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum</a>, for talks on early research. <br /><br />

We see the meeting as a timely opportunity for global exchange of ideas on artificial intelligence (AI) and the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum. As with all globalCENTRA meetings, creating a venue where global collaboration can thrive is a priority. We are thus arranging the time and spaces to allow for fruitful presentations and discussions, as well as collaborative interaction in non-meeting room settings. As AI isn’t just a technical problem, we will foster discussions that cross the social-technical threshold as well. <br /><br />

Indiana is affectionately known as the Hoosier State, those of us who have resided in the state long enough know well enough to identify ourselves as “hoosiers” (origination unknown). Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana, and the IU Indianapolis campus, where we’ll be meeting, sits on the winding White River. With its path system, the White River is an attraction for morning walks. The meeting venue on campus is a close walk to two showcase museums, The Eiteljorg Museum and the Indiana State Museum. <br /><br />

Indiana University has substantial research and innovation in international and national networking, informatics and computing, and big data. It is home to one of the fastest university-owned supercomputers in the world, a world class global network operations center (GNOC), the Jetstream2 community cloud for science research, and a new Luddy Artificial Intelligence Institute. <br /><br />

I am genuinely ecstatic to be able to host the 6th global CENTRA meeting, and the first fully in-person meeting since pre-COVID. We look forward to seeing you at CENTRA 6! <br /><br />

Executive Director, Pervasive Technology Institute<br />
Michael A and Laurie Burns McRobbie Bicentennial Professor of Computer Engineering, Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering<br />
