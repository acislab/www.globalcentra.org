<!--## Visa Information

International delegates should give special attention to visa requirements and make travel plans well in advance. Visa regulations depend on a delegate's nationality and country of origin.  

We highly recommend you to contact your local United Staes of America Consulate / Embassy for official instructions on the specific visa regulations and application procedures that may apply to you. It is your sole responsibility to obtain a visa if required.  

**Letter of Invitation**  
If you need an official letter of invitation from the Organizing Committee to initiate your visa application process, you must: 
1.	First register for the CENTRA 6 meeting and indicate that you need an invitation letter from the Organizing Committee in the registration form.
2.	Your request will be reviewed and processed within 2-4 business days, and the invitation letter will be sent to your email address.  

If you have any questions regarding visa letters, please contact [PTI@IU](mailto:pti@iu.edu)
