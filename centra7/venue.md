**About Indianapolis, Indiana, the host city, state and Indiana University**
  
IUPUI was established in 1969 and is Indiana's premier urban research university offering more than 550 undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs from Indiana University and Purdue University. Among the many campuses of Indiana University, it is second in size only to the flagship campus of Indiana University - Bloomington. Located in downtown Indianapolis, IUPUI will be the site of CENTRA 6 meetings and activities. Indianapolis is the capital city and the economic and government center of Indiana. And IUPUI is located in the center of it all.

During your stay, an exciting transition will be taking place as IUPUI transforms into two separate institutions, Indiana University Indianapolis and Purdue University in Indianapolis. [Read more about this historic agreement here](https://news.iu.edu/live/news/31735-indiana-university-indianapolis-a-new-era-of-impact-is). So as you make your way around Indianapolis, signs for IUPUI and IU Indianapolis refer to the same campus (where we will have the majority of our activities).

In Indianapolis you can dine at dusk on a patio where tonight’s entrée is made from local, farm-fresh ingredients. And make sure you stop by the International Marketplace where over 70 languages are spoken and you’ll find tasty fare from around the world. Find global premieres of a never-before-seen art exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Attend an outdoor concert at the Farm Bureau Insurance Lawn at White River State Park. Or spend some time on Mass Ave, which features five performing arts theaters.

Whether you’re traveling by foot, bicycle, bus, or car, you’ll always have access to one of Indianapolis’s six designated [Cultural Districts](http://www.downtownindy.org/explore-downtown/cultural-districts/) — where you’ll encounter thriving pockets of international and local talent, music, and art.

The **Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI) at Indiana University** is the host organization for CENTRA 6 and the accompanying workshop. PTI is a locus for activity and collaboration beyond IU — serving as a point of contact for partners external to IU and a nucleus of new ideas within IU. The “Pervasive” in the name IU Pervasive Technology Institute reflects the foundational importance of computer science, informatics, cyberinfrastructure, and information technology research to most of what is done in academia and industry today.

PTI operates outreach and training activities which reaches thousands of people throughout IU and more than 100,000 people worldwide per year. PTI supports innovation within industries operating within IT. And PTI supports job growth in Indiana, bringing millions of dollars of federal grant funding to the state.

PTI serves as a way for faculty, researchers, librarians, IT professionals, students, humanists, and artists to collaborate to advance IU’s research, creative, and educational activities. PTI spans the spectrum of research, development, delivery, and support of new technologies in ways that cross collaborating units.

The Pervasive Technology Institute at IU is led by executive director, Beth Plale, and chief operating officer, Winona Snapp-Childs.
