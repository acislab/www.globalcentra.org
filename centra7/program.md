The CENTRA 7 program is [available here on the Sched platform](https://centra6.sched.com/). 

The Sched platform allows attendees to create a profile to connect and network with other folks attending CENTRA 7.

**Pro-tips!**
In Sched, click on SCHEDULE (next to SPEAKERS, SPONSORS, etc) and then choose EXPANDED view to see the abstracts of each talk and the speaker's name.

If you see the alert YOUR PROFILE & SCHEDULE ARE HIDDEN FROM ATTENDEES when you click on your own profile or click on your profile image, then you need to go to settings and change your settings to be public so everyone attending can see you.

We strongly encourage everyone to create a Sched profile and upload your photo and biographical information. Creating your profile and encouraging others to do the same is your best bet for learning about all the attendees and networking with others who attend CENTRA 6.

**Make your Sched profile public**
To make your Sched profile public:
- Go [here](https://centra6.sched.com/)
- Login to Sched.
- Click on your image or initials in upper right corner
- Choose SETTINGS
- Under Privacy & Email, turn the switch for MAKE MY PROFILE & SCHEDULE PUBLIC to green.
