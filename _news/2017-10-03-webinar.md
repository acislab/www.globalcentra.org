**Abstract:**
 
As the number of Internet-connected devices – sensors, computing and storage devices – several opportunities arise to apply distributed sensing, processing and data staging at the network’s edge, and data analysis and long-term storage at the core of cloud computing infrastructures. In the context of smart communities, use case scenarios include crowd-sourced dynamic monitoring, involving data capture of video streams and real-time processing (e.g. image recognition). A challenge that arises is allowing stakeholders in the community to share and aggregate resources, dynamically, in particular to establish software-defined IT environments to address needs that arise during emergency events. This CENTRA project investigates approaches that build upon peer-to-peer overlay virtual private networks (VPNs) to form a basis for establishing private end-to-end communication channels among community-provided edge resources and cloud infrastructures, in a manner that hides the presence of Internet firewalls and network address translators (NATs) from applications, through a virtualization layer.  

[The project](http://www.globalcentra.org/projects/) has evolved from discussions that took place in the [CENTRA2 All-Hands Meeting](http://www.globalcentra.org/centra2/) in April 2017, with participants from University of Florida (USA), NICT, AIST, Osaka University, NAIST (Japan), Seoul National U. (South Korea). The webinar will overview the project and highlight avenues for possible additional collaborations.
