# CENTRA 2017

<p>
It is with great pleasure that we welcome CENTRA members, friends and visitors to the CENTRA 2 All-hands meeting in Gainesville, Florida. This meeting brings together international CENTRA researchers who are actively engaged in collaboration projects, or are interested in initiating joint projects that require contributions from researchers and/or cyberinfrastructure from different countries. It follows the CENTRA 1 Kickoff meeting, which took place approximately one year ago in Taipei, Taiwan. CENTRA 2 is an opportunity for reviewing and further advancing projects proposed or conceived CENTRA 1, as well as launching new projects and building new teams. The topics of these projects fall under the broad CENTRA research umbrella, i.e. software-defined cyberinfrastructure for environmental modeling, natural disaster management and smart and connected communities.

CENTRA 2 is the first of three meetings taking place in Gainesville during the week of April 10. The Smart University TOWNS (SUNTOWNS) workshop, partially sponsored by CENTRA, takes place on April 12. The 32nd PRAGMA meeting takes place April 13-14, focusing on activities related to the Internet of People and Things. In addition, we have social and technical events during the week, including informal cultural activities on April 15, to further allow for networking amongst the participants of these meetings. We hope you will consider staying beyond CENTRA 2 to participate in both meetings and associated events.

CENTRA 2 is hosted by the Advanced Computing and Information Systems laboratory of the University of Florida (UF), the leading university of the State of Florida. UF is ranked 14th amongst public US universities. The UF’s mascot is an alligator called Albert E. Gator, whom you need not fear but might be able to see in different forms when you stroll around the beautiful UF campus. I hope you take some time to admire the campus buildings, magnificent trees and Lake Alice, and get to see a gator.

We also wish to acknowledge the sponsors of the CENTRA project who make CENTRA 2 and many other CENTRA activities possible. They are the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the USA, the Center of Excellence for Cyber-Enablement of Applications (CECEA) of the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC) of Taiwan with support from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan, and the ASEAN International Virtual Organization (IVO) funded by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technologies (NICT), Japan. Additional funding for the CENTRA 2 meeting comes from the AT&T Foundation. We are very thankful for the support of all these sponsors.

Once again, welcome to CENTRA 2, to the University of Florida, to Gainesville, to the State of Florida and to the USA!
