Important notes: 

(1) PRAGMA 34 Workshop and CENTRA 3 Meeting: Smart Cyberinfrastructure for Transnational Science are held at *different* locations. PRAGMA 34 will be held at Akihabara Convention Hall near JR Akihabara Station, and CENTRA 3 Meeting: Smart Cyberinfrastructure for Transnational Science will be held at AP Tokyo Marunouchi near JR Tokyo Station. It takes about 4 minutes from JR Akihabara Station to JR Tokyo Station on the JR Yamanote Line.  

(2) While morning program of May 16 (CENTRA 3 Post-Workshop) and that of May 9 (PRAGMA 34 Pre-Workshop) are different, please expect the afternoon program is the same - touring ABCI facility, on both days. AIST organizers suggest you choose one day to join, i.e. if you are a PRAGMA 34 participant and plan to attend PRAGMA 34 ABCI Pre-Workshp on May 9, it is not necessary to attend CENTRA 3 ABCI Post-Workshop on May 16.
