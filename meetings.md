I am a computer scientist and engineer teaching at the University of Florida. I am also the Director of the Advanced Computing and Information Systems (ACIS) lab. My research interests are in the areas of distributed computing, autonomic computing, computer architecture, parallel processing and fault-tolerant computing. I have also worked extensively in the development of e-science cyberinfrastructures, including PUNCH, Nanohub, FutureGrid and iDigBio. Currently, I am particularly interested in all aspects of software-defined systems and how they introduce new questions in the above-listed areas. Transnational contexts are of particular interest to me because they bring out the need for collaborative autonomics across software stacks that are deep and/or distributed among different administrative domains.
